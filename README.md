Awful, I know. Make a better one if you want to.

Currently it's these 2 things combined:
- <https://thenounproject.com/term/crane/1689627/> (bought the rights to use)
- <https://material.io/resources/icons/?icon=directions_bus&style=outline> (apache 2.0)


Development
-----------

This project uses `isort` and `black` for file formatting and `pyright` for type checking.
The maximum line length is increased to 99, and the type checking is set to strict.

CI runs the following commands to help maintain high code quality:

```console
$ black --check .
$ isort --check .
$ pyright
$ python -m pytest
```

If you use VS Code I recommend using the following settings:

```json
{
    "[python]": {
        "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
            "source.organizeImports": true
        },
        "editor.formatOnSave": true
    },
    "js/ts.implicitProjectConfig.checkJs": true,
    "python.formatting.provider": "black",
    "python.languageServer": "Pylance",
    "python.linting.enabled": false,
}
```
